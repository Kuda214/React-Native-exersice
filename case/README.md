# HealthDart case
## _May the odds be ever in your favour

The case below is designed to test your technical comprehension, technical ability, basic front end design and integration to API's.

You will need to build this app using react-native. To get started

- Download the codebase from GitHub
- Get the shell app running on your machine
- ✨Magic ✨

## Included

- This app is a container app which has react-navigation, react-native-vector icons and asset files
- In the assets/svg folder exists the asset files needed for the project
- In the assets/data folder exists the data file needed for the project
- The icons for the bottom navigation bar can be sourced from vector-icons library

-- HealthDart asset files
-- React-Navigation
-- Header Tab switches

## Think about
- Design and layout
- Code reusability
- Write code as if you are working in a large team of developers
- code neatness
- code management
- problem solving
- use programming constructs like loops, if statements, arrays if needed

## What we will look out for
- We will check out your code for all the above mentioned and anything you do above and beyond the scope

## Installation

the case requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v14+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
